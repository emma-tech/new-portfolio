    about: "This was a team assignment and company case study from the Technigo UX bootcamp. Our task was to look at Feeder.co's onboarding experience for new users on desktop, with the specific aim to increase activation. Feeder is a news manager that tracks any online source you choose and bundles it into an easy-to-digest reading experience. It let’s you subscribe to any news site, website or blog and get all new posts in a single feed. They're a Stockholm based company with a very global product. The Feeder.co platform has over 700,000 registered users, with the main user base in the USA.",

    background: "Feeder has a problem in activation and retention. In short there is an opportunity and potential to increase activation of users – which will lead to more customers through out the whole funnel. Feeder defines an active user as a person that keeps coming back to use their product regularly, within a 30 day period. One important event is the “read post”, which means they are actually getting value from Feeder. Feeder knows that it’s important for new users to quickly start adding feeds to their account, if they don’t do that, they tend to not come back to the product again. This lead us to formulate the idea that we wanted to create an engaging and effective primary onboarding, and a more personalized and customized overall experience for Feeders users.",
    solution: "Since we know that the read post-event is one of the most important events for activating users on Feeder, we wanted to include this right away in the onboarding process. We gave the user the opportunity to add feeds directly in the onboarding, so that there would always be content to read immediately when entering the platform. We also integrated a new Add Feed-button in the sidebar for making adding of new feeds more accessible. We also wanted to give the users the opportunity to customize their experience by lifting an already existing theme preferences functionality already in the onboarding. Customization lets users make their own selections about what they want to see, or set preferences for how information is organized or displayed. It can enhance user experience because it allows users to control their interaction. All our research and findings starts in growth design through onboarding best practices and UX psychology principles.",
    process: "All four team members started a new account and attempted to learn and use Feeder. We compiled our impressions and ideas into one single analysis of Feeders first-time user experience. We also benchmarked and analysed the first-time user experience by each opening an account in similar services, and then compared these experiences to the first-time user experience we had gotten from Feeder. After our initial research and benchmarking, we found that the main pain points were to be found in Feeders onboarding for new users. We facilitated a reverse brainstorming session to define the cause of the problem and come up with new solutions for Feeders onboarding and user activation. We wanted to tell a story and form a deeper understanding of our users' goals, needs, experiences, and behaviors. So, we created a persona and used this persona to test and present the various ideas we had for Feeders new onboarding experience on desktop. We wanted to create an engaging and effective primary onboarding and a more customized overall experience for Feeder. We compiled design suggestions for activation based on UX psychology and nudging principles, and created a simple mockup prototype to show the general idea of how a new onboarding and reading experience could work for Feeder.",
    feedback1: "LOVED your presentation! The language, design, the way you walked us through your ideas step by step. Great job! I also loved that you included the app in your idea - feels like you came up with a wholesome approach. That you distinguished between B2B and B2C users - also feels like you took the bigger picture into consideration. Also loved the Add feed-button integrated in the sidebar. - Elissa, frontend developer at Feeder",
    feedback2: "Letting the user speak for herself is genius. It really made me empathise with the users as an audience member. If I where you, I would keep using this way to present moving forward too! Let it be your secret recipe. Great use of storytelling and I really felt sold by your idea. - Hanna, teacher and co-founder at Technigo",
