Because I love yoga, I chose to create a design for a fictional yoga studio. I created a design system, wireframes and prototypes in Figma, and then had a classic designer-developer handover to a developer in the web bootcamp who was tasked with building my design with React. The following week we built the desktop version of our landing pages ourselves using only HTML and CSS.",

Our mission was to follow the design system and sketches we received from our UX team and recreate the design as pixel-perfect as possible, and also make sure that the design was responsive and scaled up nicely from mobile to desktop. I also built template websites and parts of the design system into a styleguide for the web editors so that they would have a simple overview of the design system, different elements and components and how they should be used for the web.",

The task I was given was to remake the experience and event pages to better match Nässjö's place brand, #ettannatsmåland. For example I created a new template and layout for experiences and events, created a web app in React for making it easier for editors to create linked cards do different experiences. I also did a retake of the styling on the Events page and the Search page for experiences.",

Their goal is to be your go-to place to research and review online brands. Thingtesting’s biggest objective is to provide consumers with honest reviews about internet-born brands. To do so, they want to increase the number of tested product and reviews on their site thingtesting.com. Our task was to analyse their website and their user data from Hotjar heatmaps and user recordings and suggest UX improvements for their website from the insights we collected. One of our key insights was that the users seemed to have trouble finding the categories for different brands, and also not finishing their profile in order to make reviews, so we made a suggestion of lifting the categories on the startpage and a more direct CTA for the signup and onboarding flow.",
