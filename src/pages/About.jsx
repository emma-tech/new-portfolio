        Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio Iâ€™m Emma, a UX designer with a
        background in frontend development and communication. My passion is to
        build inclusive, creative and problem-solving user experiences and
        products that makes sense to people. User experience and inclusive
        design have always been close to my heart, so after working with
        communication and frontend development for a few years I decided that it
        was time to turn this passion into a reality. So I added that final
        piece to my career puzzle, added all my previous experience together and
        started a course with Technigo to deep dive into the world of UX design.
        I truly believe that having a background in communication and as an
        IT-consultant in frontend development is what make me stand out as a UX
        designer, since I can understand and empathise with a lot of different
        stakeholders when developing digital products.
